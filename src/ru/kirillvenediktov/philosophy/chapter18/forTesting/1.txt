A documentary crew arrives to the Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch to experience a day of work at a seemingly ordinary paper company. However, this office is anything but ordinary.

Oblivious Regional Manager Michael Scott sees himself as "a friend first, entertainer second, and boss third". Michael is entirely unaware that his co-workers would only seldom agree. Michael's offensive shenanigans and jokes turn them off rather than make them laugh.

Michael fights to keep spirits up despite the looming threat of downsizing and bleak outlook of the branch.

Salesman Jim Halpert doesn't care much for his job. His workdays mainly feature flirting with engaged receptionist Pam Beesly, and pulling pranks on co-worker and Assistant to the Regional Manager Dwight Schrute.

Dwight, the top salesman in the office, worships Michael who is annoyed and yet seemingly pleased by Dwight's habit of sucking up to him. Dwight is best characterized by his humorous obsession with power and authoritarian style in the workplace. He is the owner of a 60-acre beet farm, named Schrute Farms.

Pam, the receptionist, is engaged to warehouse worker Roy. However she seems to have a greater connection with Jim who has a secret crush on her. Pam and Jim's favorite hobby in the office is to annoy and orchestrate pranks on Dwight.
